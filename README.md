# iOS Coding Challenge for SWENSON HE #

- I. Add arithmetic operators (add, subtract, multiply, divide) to make the following expressions true. You can use any parentheses youâ€™d like. 3 1 3 9 = 12
- II. Write a function/method utilizing Swift to determine whether two strings are anagrams or not (examples of anagrams: debit card/bad credit, punishments/nine thumps, etc.)
- III. Write a method in Swift to generate the nth Fibonacci number (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34) 
    * A. recursive approach
    * B. iterative approach
- IV. Which architecture would you use for the required task below? Why? 
- V. Create a currency converter by utilizing data from the fixer.io API. The currency converter must include a currency selector at the top to use as the base currency and display updated currency rates based on the selected base currency. When a user taps on a currency, a calculation view should appear with the selected currency and base currency. Only the base currency field should be editable. Feel free to use any open source libraries. (Consider this project as if you were developing a component within a large-scaled project)
