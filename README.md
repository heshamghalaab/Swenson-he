## Dev Notes ##

### Design Pattern
- This project uses the **Hierarchical Model View Controller(HMVC) pattern**, as it has the below key values:
* **Modularization:** Reduction of dependencies between the disparate parts of the application.
* **Organization:** Having a folder for each of the relevant triads makes for a lighter work load.
* **Reusability:** By nature of the design it is easy to reuse nearly every piece of code.
* **Extendibility:** Makes the application more extensible without sacrificing ease of maintenance.

### Unit Testing
- The project uses XCTest for unit test.
